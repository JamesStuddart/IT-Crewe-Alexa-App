# The IT Crewe - Chuck Norris Demo - Alexa Skill

This sample project is a quick and dirty demo application, used by [James Studdart](https://twitter.com/JamesStuddart) to demonstrate Alex Skill development with .Net Core and AWS Lambdas at [The IT Crewe](https://www.meetup.com/The-IT-Crewe/) tech meet-up.

##The code...

The code in this project is for demo purposes and does not adhere to any rules, or patterns. It is just enough code to get something working.

Do what you want with the code, but most of all enjoy, and don't blame me because Alexa cannot say Norris correctly!
